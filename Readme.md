# Machine Learning Experiments

## Supervised Learning to recognize 3 characters using Octave
1. Open octave
2. Make q1 as working directory
3. To train the network again

* Run make_dataset.m file to create datasets
    ```
    >> make_dataset
    ``` 
* Run training.m file to create and train the network
    ```
    training
    ``` 
* Run testing.m file to test the trained network with testing dataset
    ```
    testing
    ```
